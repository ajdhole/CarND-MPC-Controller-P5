## Introduction

This projects implements the Model Predictive Controls using vehicle kinematics motion models. To control vehicle it takes initial vehicle position and heading direction from simulator and based on motion models it predicts future position and required controls to acehive that position.

## Vehicle Kinematics Model

 The state, actuators and how the state changes over time based on the previous state and current actuator inputs is given by below equations:
 
 xt+1 = xt+vt∗cos(ψt)∗dt

yt+1 = yt+vt∗sin(ψt)∗dt

ψt+1 = ψt+Lf/vt∗δt∗dt

vt+1 = vt+at∗dt

Where:

* xt - xt is the global map coordinate x of the current location of the vehicle
* yt - yt is the global map coordinate y of the current location of the vehicle
* ψt - the current heading angle/ direction heading of the vehicle
* vt - the current speed/ velocity of the vehicle.

To check the difference between current vehicle position and desired vehicle position we have defined two errors 1) Cross Track Errors and 2) Orientation Error

1) Cross Track Errors(CTE)
We can express CTE, the error between the center of the road and the vehicle's position as the cross track error:

cte(t+1) = cte(t)+vt∗sin(eψt)∗dt

In this case cte(t) can be expressed as the difference between the line and the current vehicle position y. Assuming the reference line is a 1st order polynomial f:

cte(t) =f(xt)−yt

If we substitute cte(t)back into the original equation the result is:

cte(t+1) = f(xt)−yt+(vt∗sin(eψt)∗dt)

2) Orientation Error

Oriantation error is modelled as 
eψ(t+1) = ψt−ψdest+(vt/Lf∗δt∗dt)

## Length and Duration
The prediction horizon is the duration over which future predictions are made. We have deifed it as T. T is the product of two other variables, N and dt.
N is the number of timesteps in the horizon. dt is how much time elapses between actuations. For example, if N were 20 and dt were 0.5, then T would be 10 seconds.

For our model based on number of iterations and optimization N value is 10 and  dt is 0.1.

## Fitting Polynomials
The reference trajectory is typically passed to the control block as a polynomial. This polynomial is usually 3rd order, since third order polynomials will fit trajectories for most roads. To fit 3rd order polynomials to waypoints (x, y), we have used 'polyfit' to fit a 3rd order polynomial to the given x and y coordinates representing waypoints and 'polyeval' to evaluate y values of given x coordinates.

## Model Predictive Control with Latency
In a real car, an actuation command won't execute instantly - there will be a delay as the command propagates through the system. A realistic delay might be on the order of 100 milliseconds.

This is a problem called "latency", and it's a difficult challenge for some controllers - like a PID controller - to overcome. But a Model Predictive Controller can adapt quite well because we can model this latency in the system.
We have considered Latency 0.1 i.e. prediction 100 ms in future. and it is implemented in main.cpp as given below:

```         state[0] = v*cos(0)*latency;
            state[1] = v*sin(0)*latency;
            state[2] = (-v*steer_value*latency/Lf);
            state[3] = v + throttle_value*latency;
            state[4] = cte + v*sin(epsi)*latency;
            state[5] = epsi - (v/Lf)*steer_value*latency;
```

* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
